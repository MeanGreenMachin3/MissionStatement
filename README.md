# MissionStatement
Every organization has to have a mission and this is ours

## Purpose

Optimize smart gardens to grow produce at the cheapest costs with the best quality to feed the population for 2050 in compact space indoors

## Goal

Add all the home recipes for the best produce production with the resources we have today

## Key Concepts

We want to document all the best techniques for growing each produce at the best yields with the lowest costs

- All costs must be measured time, space, resources, and number of reuses

- All yields must be organic, pesticide free, and sustainable to feed the population in 2050

- All engineering must have "Mother Nature" in mind for the sake of sanity. Giving plants the perfect environments to grow and yield in the perfect conditions for the shortest amount of growth time

- Dwarf Trees for fruit trees is a perfect idea formed by gene breeding/splicing for faster yields for similar produce

## Storage

- Free storage for recipes to save the world from hungry
